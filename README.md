# A smooth path to plot hydrogen atom via Monte Carlo method

We deal with typical problems of the particle in the boxes and 
we show how to draw the hydrogen atom orbitals, in a friendly manner to 
undergraduates. The methodology is based on the Monte Carlo method that was 
previously explored by M. Goto & V. De Aquino Manoel 
([DOI:10.5433/1679-0375.1992v13n4p255](http://dx.doi.org/10.5433/1679-0375.1992v13n4p255)),
but we focused on covering all the steps in more detail, with some added 
automation, and from a pedagogical perspective.
